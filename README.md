# Untis Lesson Countdown
This is a program I made to show me when my lesson would end. Jep, that's all it does.

Uses [this](https://github.com/schletz/UntisLibrary) library to interface with WebUntis.

### Config
This cli program takes the config path as the first parameter. Defaults to `./config.json` if no parameter is given.
